Build a B2B fuel management web platform for transporters and fleet owners where they can digitally order diesel/petrol for their vehicles, make online payments, and get fuel delivered/authorized at partner fuel pumps.

The platform should work as:

A responsive web application (PWA-ready)
With multiple user roles
Manual operations in MVP, scalable to automation later

2️⃣ Transporter / Fleet Owner (Customer)

3️⃣ Driver (Indirect User)


Receives fuel at pump using OTP (no login required in MVP).


4️⃣ Fuel Pump Partner (Optional – Phase 2)
